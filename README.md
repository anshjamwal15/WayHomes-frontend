# WayHomes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimbot1526/dumper-frontend/develop/assets/images/dumper-no-bg.png)


An Realestate application that does not use/share your data.

## Inspiration

Recently I thought to create a full stack project on my own, As I was just a backend-developer so just to improve my skills I started this project.

Hence, I decided to design and implement WayHomes as a hobby project in my free time.

PS. UI is Heavily inspired by some good designers on github 🤪, I was unable to copy it properly. The code is not perfect but I'm still improving it 😄

Please leave a ⭐ as motivation if you liked the idea 😄
